# EBM python training packages
These packages offers key utilities to train an Energy Based Model with MCMC Langevin sampling.  
Currently under development:
- ebm: train on MNIST dataset
- ebm_toy: train on `gmm` (gaussian mixture model) or `circles` 2D datasets, where the ground truth distribution is known and supervised metrics (e.g. Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance) can be computed.
